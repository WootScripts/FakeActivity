A collection of Powershell scripts that generate fake activity to keep your system active

I made this script collection to allow people to have some extra time to do off-screen work while still appearing active on-screen. When one of the scripts is ran in PowerShell or PowerShell IDE (prefered) it will open Notepad.exe and place a '# ' within the document every 60 secs. The keypress mimic will keep the system active and show user active with IM titles like Skype or MS Teams, while also keeping group policy set screensavers and power settings from taking effect. This script will allow the user the walk away from the system or use another without need to worry about timeout on their system.

You can easily change the time lapse, text editor and symbol that is used.
